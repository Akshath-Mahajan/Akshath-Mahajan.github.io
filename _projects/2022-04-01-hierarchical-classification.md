- Designed innovative **neural architectures** for hierarchical classification, improving prediction accuracy by **2%** at finer levels and **15%** at coarser levels compared to prior techniques  
- Reduced disparity between predictions across levels of **bird taxonomy hierarchy** by applying an **ensemble learning approach**, resulting in a **12% increase** in overall classification accuracy
