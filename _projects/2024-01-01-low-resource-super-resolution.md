- Proposed **pre-upsampling techniques** to achieve **32.99 PSNR** and **0.9051 SSIM** with minimal training  
- Implemented and compared **6 unique techniques** for image super resolution under constrained training budgets  
- Achieved **1.5Ã— performance** over baseline GANs using **pre-upsampled UNet architectures**
