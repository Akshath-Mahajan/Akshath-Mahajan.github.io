- Developed a **cycle-accurate simulator** for **VMIPS-based vector processors** with **6 pipelined functional units**  
- Implemented **machine learning algorithms** using the ISA, including **dot products**, **matrix multiplications**, and **strided convolution layers**  
- Conducted **design space exploration** to optimize configurations, resulting in up to **35% faster execution** across benchmarks  
- Introduced novel **architecture optimizations**, improving performance by **15% (dot product)**, **20% (matrix multiplication)**, and **10% (convolution)**  
- Improved **memory access efficiency** via **parallel memory bank access**, reducing dot product execution time by **33%** and convolution by **27%**
